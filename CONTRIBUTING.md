# Contributing to Squid Proxy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Squid Proxy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/lferrarotti74/SquidProxy/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lferrarotti74/SquidProxy/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- A text editor or IDE
- Basic knowledge of Squid proxy configuration

### Setting up the development environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SquidProxy.git
   cd SquidProxy
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image locally**
   ```bash
   docker build -t squidproxy:dev .
   ```

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run the container
   docker run -d --name squid-test -p 3128:3128 squidproxy:dev
   
   # Test the proxy
   curl -x localhost:3128 http://httpbin.org/ip
   
   # Check health
   docker exec squid-test /healthcheck.sh
   
   # Clean up
   docker stop squid-test && docker rm squid-test
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Shell Scripts
- Use `#!/bin/sh` for maximum compatibility
- Follow POSIX shell standards
- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test scripts on Alpine Linux

### Docker
- Use multi-stage builds when beneficial
- Minimize image layers
- Follow Docker best practices
- Use specific version tags, not `latest`
- Include health checks

### Configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Document all configuration options
- Validate configuration when possible
- Support environment variable overrides

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Build and run the container**
   ```bash
   docker build -t squidproxy:test .
   docker run -d --name squid-test -p 3128:3128 squidproxy:test
   ```

2. **Test proxy functionality**
   ```bash
   # Test HTTP proxy
   curl -x localhost:3128 http://httpbin.org/ip
   
   # Test HTTPS proxy (if configured)
   curl -x localhost:3128 https://httpbin.org/ip
   ```

3. **Test health check**
   ```bash
   docker exec squid-test /healthcheck.sh
   echo $?  # Should return 0
   ```

4. **Test with custom configuration**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name squid-custom \
     -p 3129:3128 \
     -v ./test-config.conf:/etc/squid/squid.conf:ro \
     squidproxy:test
   ```

### Automated Testing
- GitHub Actions run automated tests on pull requests
- Tests include:
  - Docker image build
  - Container startup
  - Health check validation
  - Basic proxy functionality
  - Security scanning
